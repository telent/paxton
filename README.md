# Paxton

A compositor for Wayland (written in/extensible using) Clojurescript

Doesn't work yet

```
$ nix-shell
[nix-shell:~/src/paxton]$ eval $repl paxton.cljs
Could not load source-map support
```

In another winow you can now run e.g. `weston-terminal` which will
render its initial window and then the whole thing hangs unresponsive
